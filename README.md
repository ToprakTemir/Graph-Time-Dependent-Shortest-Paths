# Graph-Time-Dependent-Shortest-Paths
Algorithm to find shortest path for an airplane to take to destination, taking into account travel times between nodes and changing weather conditions with time. The goal is trying to minimise the "cost" of the path which is influenced by distance between nodes and the weather conditions when entering or exiting a node.
